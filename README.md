# Gorman Trees

Set of treebanks published by Vanessa Gorman at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Based on the template [here](https://github.com/perseids-publications/treebank-template).

## How to configure with your own treebanks

```
git clone git@github.com:perseids-publications/treebank-template.git my-trees
cd my-trees
git remote rename origin source
git remote add origin <my-trees origin>
git push -u origin master
```

* Copy all your trees into `public/xml`
* Update the `src/config.json` file
* Update `name` and `homepage` in `package.json`
* Set the version in `package.json` to `1.0.0`
* Update the information in `.env`

### Configuration

See [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md) for more information about the format of `src/config.json`.

### Updating

#### Manually

The best way to update the code is to use git's built in merging functionality.
A typical update may involve the following steps:

* `git pull source master --no-commit` (if there is no `source` repository, then run
  `git remote add source https://github.com/perseids-publications/treebank-template.git`
  then `git pull source master --no-commit`)
* Fix merge conflicts:
```bash
git checkout --theirs .
git checkout --ours public/xml
git checkout --ours .env
git checkout --ours README.md
git checkout --ours src/config.json
```
* Run `git status`. In some cases there may be files that are marked as `deleted by them`.
  For each of these, do `git rm <path-to-file>`
* The `package.json` needs to be edited manually. The `name`, `version,` and `homepage` fields should reflect
  `origin`, while all other values should reflect `source`
* `git add .`
* `git commit`
* `git push origin master`

#### GitHub Actions

There is an experimental workflow that updates the code automatically.
Instead of `git merge`, it uses `git restore --source`. For more information
about the technical aspects, see
[.github/workflows/update.yml](.github/workflows/update.yml) and the files in
[scripts/](scripts/).

To use this workflow:

1. Click the "Actions" on the top of the repository on GitHub
2. Click "update" under the list of workfows
3. Click "Run workflow" and then either click the green "Run workflow" button
   or enter the tag you'd like to use (e.g. `3.2.0`) then click the button.

## Installation

`yarn install`

## Running the development server

`yarn start`

## Building for deployment

Before creating a production build you need to know the path where it will be accessed.
Then run the command `PUBLIC_URL='./path/of/app' yarn build`.
This will generate a set of static files in the `build/` directory that you can serve.

For example, if you want to deploy it at `www.example.com/` then run `PUBLIC_URL='./' yarn build`.
If you want to deploy it at `www.example.com/lexica/lsj` then run
`PUBLIC_URL='./lexica/lsj' yarn build`.

## Deploying a new version to github.io

`yarn deploy`

## Zenodo DOI

The instructions below are for uploading a collection of treebanks to Zenodo.
The Treebank Template repository itself is uploaded to Zenodo but the steps are slightly different
(the version of the Treebank Template application is used for the version, the upload type is software, the contributors are different, and the license is MIT instead of CC BY-SA)

### Zenodo

* Visit [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/deposit/new), log in, and create a new upload
* Click the "Reserve DOI" button in the "Basic information" section
* Keeping the window open, open your command line/console and navigate to the repository

### Git

* In `src/config.json`, add or update the `doi` field to the DOI generated in the above step (preceded by `https://dx.doi.org/`)
* Update the version in `package.json` (try to use [SemVer](https://semver.org/))
* Push the code to `master`
* Keeping the Zenodo window open, in another tab or window open the repository on GitHub

### GitHub

* Make a new release titled "Release vA.B.C" where "A.b.C" is the version in `package.json` and use the same string ("vA.B.C") in the "Tag Version" field
* Enter a description then click "Publish release"
* Download the release as a `tar.gz` file
* Go back to the Zenodo window or tab

### Zenodo

* Add the `tar.gz` file to the upload
* Fill in the following fields:
  * Communities: add the `perseids-project` community and any others that may be relevant
  * Upload type: Dataset
  * Basic information:
    * Title: the title of the treebank collection
    * Authors: the author(s) who contributed to the treebanks
    * Description: a description of the dataset
    * Version: the version in `package.json`
  * License:
    * Access right: Open Access
    * License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
  * Fill in any other fields that are relevant
* Click "Publish"
